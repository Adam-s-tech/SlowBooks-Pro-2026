"""A theme toggle redraws charts that are on screen.

Canvas ink is painted with the theme active when the chart was created, so a
toggle left the dashboard's Balance Sheet Trend with light-mode axis text on a
dark panel — 1.06:1 (skytech, 2.16.0 gate). The Analytics page had carried the
same flaw since it shipped. `App.toggleTheme` now announces the change and
both pages redraw.
